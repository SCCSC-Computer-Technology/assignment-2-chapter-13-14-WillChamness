Code Review for William :)

When prompting the user for input, the author's error handling messages give the user
the help they need. If you want to be clearer, it might help to clarify to the user
that they must provide a numerical value. I think this will help the code to be more
user-friendly and simple to use.

The author of this code chose to use many forms, but I used a single form in my code. After looking through the author's code, I believe that incorporating multiple forms is a more organized method. This method makes the code simpler to read and makes maintenance and future additions easier.
