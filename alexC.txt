 The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of each section and the logic behind certain decisions. Adding comments can improve code readability and help other developers understand the code.
The user interface is functional, but there could be improvements for usability. For example, providing feedback to the user after performing a search operation, such as displaying the number of results found.
Overall good code.
